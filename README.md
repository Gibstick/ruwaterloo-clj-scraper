This scraper is a read-only OAuth2 app. To obtain a client secret and a
client id, navigate to the `apps` section of reddit preferences and create
a script-type app.

Run with `--help` flag to see the options. Notably, use `--wait` to scrape
in a loop. A user agent is required, and should be provided with `--user-agent`.
